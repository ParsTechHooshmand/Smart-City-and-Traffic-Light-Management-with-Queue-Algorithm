# Smart City Traffic Control v2.1.8

## Challenge Description

Design a smart traffic light system at a busy intersection using queue, prioritization, and automatic control in the browser.

### Challenge Goal

Simulate a 4-way intersection in a smart city to:

- Optimize traffic flow
- Prioritize vehicles (normal, priority, emergency)
- Automatically decide which path opens based on real-time analysis

### Scenario

You're developing the traffic control AI for the city “Innoverse.” Vehicles appear randomly and if unmanaged, traffic jams occur. The system must handle automatic traffic flow, emergency routing, and adapt to weather and rush hour conditions.

## Input/Output

**Input:** 
- Automatic car generation every ~2.5s
- User interaction via buttons/shortcuts (start, pause, reset, weather, emergency)
- Weather/rush hour dynamically affect simulation

**Output:** 
- Visual display of intersection, queues, lights, and car movement
- Metrics: Vehicle counts, wait time, efficiency, throughput
- AI predictions: Congestion, rush hour, weather impact
- Logs, system performance, emergency handling

## Our Solution

### HTML (index.html)
Defines UI layout: intersection grid, stats, commands, logs, etc.

### CSS (style.css)
Cyberpunk/terminal theme: animated cars/lights, neon colors, responsive layout

### JavaScript (script.js)

#### Main Class: `SmartTrafficSystem`
- Initializes queues, stats, AI predictors, event bindings
- Generates vehicles every few seconds
- Adjusts for weather/rush/emergencies
- Traffic light logic with delay transitions
- Priority-based queue processing

#### Core Functions

- `generateCar()`: Adds random cars with different priority
- `calculateOptimalDirection()`: Scores each direction and picks the best
- `runTrafficCycle()`: Main loop (analyze → pick direction → process cars)
- `processCars()`: Moves top cars, updates stats and logs
- `changeTrafficLights()`: Transitions lights with delays
- `updateEfficiency()`: Calculates and updates system efficiency

---

## Algorithms Used

- **Priority Queuing:** Cars sorted by priority and arrival time
- **Dynamic Scoring:** Considers car priority, wait time, emergencies, queue length, and weather
- **Emergency Override:** Clears path for emergency vehicles
- **Weather/Rush Detection:** Modifies timings and generation rates

---

## Creativity Highlights

- Sci-fi inspired UI
- Dynamic weather and rush hour adjustment
- Step-by-step algorithm visualization
- AI predictor for congestion/weather
- Multiple emergency types (ambulance/fire/evacuation)
- Keyboard shortcuts (F1-F4)
- Real-time system logging and performance monitoring
